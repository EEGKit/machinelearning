# Introduction

The Bonsai.ML project is a collection of Bonsai packages for implementing machine learning algorithms in Bonsai. Below you will find the list of packages available within the Bonsai.ML collection.

* Bonsai.ML - provides core functionality across all Bonsai.ML packages.
* [Bonsai.ML.LinearDynamicalSystems](LinearDynamicalSystems/lds-overview.md) - interfaces with the [lds_python](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python) package and supports the use of Kalman Filter models to infer kinematic data. Requires additional installation steps (see [here](LinearDynamicalSystems/lds-overview.md)).
* Bonsai.ML.Visualizers - provides a set of visualizers for dynamic graphing/plotting.

*Note* Bonsai.ML packages are installed through Bonsai's integrated package manager and are typically available for use immediately. However, certain packages may require additional steps for installation. See the dedicated package section for specific guides and documentation.
