# Overview

The LinearDynamicalSystems package provides a Bonsai interface to interact with the [lds_python](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python) package.

### General Guide

Since the package relies on Bonsai **and** python, both Bonsai and Python installation steps are required. We provide detailed instructions for installing the package in a new environment, for example when adding the package to existing workflows, and seperately provide documentation for how to install/run examples which can be bootstrapped directly from the example folder.

To install the package for integrating with existing workflows, see the [Installation Guide - Windows](lds-installation-guide-windows.md) or the [Installation Guide - Linux](lds-installation-guide-linux.md) sections for more information. To head directly to integrating the package into workflows, see the [Getting Started](lds-getting-started.md) section. To test the specific examples provided, check out the [Examples](../../../examples/README.md) tab.
