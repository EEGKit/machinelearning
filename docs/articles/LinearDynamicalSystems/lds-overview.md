# Overview

The LinearDynamicalSystems package provides a Bonsai interface to interact with the [lds_python](https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python) package.

### General Guide

Since the package relies on both Bonsai and python, both Bonsai and Python installation steps are required.

To install the package, see the [Installation Guide - Windows](lds-installation-guide-windows.md) or the [Installation Guide - Linux](lds-installation-guide-linux.md) sections for more information.
